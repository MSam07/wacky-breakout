# wacky-breakout
Wacky Breakout works a lot like regular Breakout, where you try to remove all the blocks on the screen by hitting a ball with a paddle. 

There is a simple menu.

There are special blocks that freeze the paddle and speedup balls. The game also spawns a new ball every few seconds, so there are regularly multiple balls in play at the same time.
